# Colonizer

Colonizer is a tool developed to better analyze the popular board game, Settler of Catan. It can help (beginner) players make better decisions and understand their common gameplay mistakes such as placing a suboptimal initial settlement, or performing an unfavorable trade using economic theories.

Colonizer keeps track of statistics to help a player make better decisions. Currently, I am only focusing on the initial settlement placements, but eventually I'd hope that Colonizer can become a bot that can  make decisions on its own for the whole duration of the game.

This app is built in Python and uses [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for UI/UX.

## Loading a Specific Game

Games should be loaded using the GameBoards.xlsx file, 1 game per row.

For example, if we are trying to load the below game as game 1:

Format: ![Alt Text](https://github.com/kennethshsu/Colonizer/blob/main/ReadMe%20Support/Setup%20Example.png)

1. In the GameBoards file, we will put 1 in column A
2. Columns B:T will be the resource tiles
3. Game resource tiles should be recorded, from left to right, row by row. For example, the game below will be recorded as (row 1) Lumber, Brick, Rock, (row 2) Sheep, Wood, Sheep, Wheat...
4.

## Feedback & Contribution

While this is my first major project using Python, I really would appreciate any feedback that you may have. Feedback both good or bad will help me learn and get better.

Contributions are welcome as well. I love cooperating with people and get new ideas!

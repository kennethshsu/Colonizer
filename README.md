# Colonizer

Colonizer is a tool developed for the popular board game, Settler of Catan. It can help (beginner) players make better decisions and understand their common gameplay mistakes such as giving away an unfavorable trade using economic theories.

Colonizer keeps track of statistics and to help a player make better decisions. Currently, I am only focusing on the initial settlement placements, but  eventually I'd hope that it comes a bot to be able to make decisions on its own for the whole duration of the game.

This app is built in Python and uses [tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) for UI/UX.
